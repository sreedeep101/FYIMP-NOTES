    <h2>HISTORY of HTML</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, who was a contractor at CERN, proposed and<br/>prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.</li>
      <li>In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.</li>
      <li>Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.</li>
      <li>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",<br/>first mentioned on the Internet by Berners-Lee in late 1991.</li>
      <li>In the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification was released.</li>
      <li>Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial <br/>software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</li>
      <li>In 2004 development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology<br/>Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, <br/>and completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.</li>
