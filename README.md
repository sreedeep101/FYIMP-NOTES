* it is just a python programme to add 2 integer value. 
  And also it was my first prigramme experience in python...
if it is written in c language 
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int num1,num2,sum;
printf("enter number 1\n");
scanf("%d",&num1);
printf("enter number 2\n");
scanf("%d",&num2);
sum=num1+num2;
printf("sum=%d",sum);
}
It would be like this.
So python is very much simple to do like operation.
THANK YOU....
