## Java Practical Questions – Inheritance, Interfaces, Packages & Exception Handling

#### 1. Method Overriding 
```
Write a Java program to create a superclass Animal with a method sound(). Create
subclasses Dog and Cat that override the sound() method. Display the appropriate sound for
each animal.

#### 2. Dynamic Method Dispatch
```
Write a Java program to demonstrate dynamic method dispatch using a superclass Shape
and subclasses Circle and Rectangle. Override the draw() method in each subclass and
invoke it using a superclass reference.
```

#### 3. Abstract Class
```
Write a Java program to create an abstract class Vehicle containing an abstract method
start() and a concrete method display(). Create subclasses Car and Bike and implement the
start() method in each subclass.
```
#### 4. Defining and Implementing an Interface
```
Define an interface Printable with a method print(). Create classes Student and Teacher that
implement the interface. Write a program to display the details of a student and a teacher
using the print() method.
```
#### 5. Multiple Interfaces
```
Write a Java program to demonstrate the implementation of multiple interfaces. Define
interfaces Sports and Academics, each containing one method. Create a class Student that
implements both interfaces and displays the student's academic and sports information.
```
#### 6. Packages – Declaring and Importing a Package
```
Create a package named college containing a class Student with a method to display student
details. Write another Java program outside the package to import the college package and
access the Student class.
```
#### 7. Sub-packages
```
Create a package structure college.department. Define a class ITStudent inside the
department sub-package with a method to display student information. Write another Java
program to import and use this class.
```

#### 8. try-catch Exception Handling
```
Write a Java program to accept two integers from the user and perform division. Use try-
catch to handle the ArithmeticException that occurs when the denominator is zero.
```

#### 9. throw and throws
```
Write a Java program to create a method checkAge(int age) that throws an exception using
the throw keyword when the age is less than 18. Declare the exception using throws and
handle it in the calling method.
```

#### 10. Multiple Exceptions and finally
```
Write a Java program that accepts an array index and performs an operation on an array.
Use try-catch to handle ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and another appropriate
exception. Use a finally block to display a message indicating that exception handling has
been completed.
```
